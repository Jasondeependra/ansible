+## Ansible
+
+**Ansible dependencies**
+
+To manage third-party Ansible roles which are dependencies of our project we use
+the requirements file. To install all the dependencies use:
+
+```bash
+$ ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
+```
+
+**Ansible Vault**
+
+We use Ansible Vault to hold all the sensitive data private. To edit the vault, execute:
+
+```bash
+$ ansible-vault edit ./ansible/vars/vault.yml
+```
+
+And enter the correct password. The password from our vault is `beefpass`.
+For your own vaults you would probably use much stronger passwords and keep them secret.
+
+**Create EC2 instance**
+
+You can create a new AWS EC2 instance manually in Amazon dashboard or execute our
+`aws.yml` playbook:
+
+```bash
+$ ansible-playbook ./ansible/aws.yml -i ./ansible/hosts.ini --ask-vault-pass
+```
+
+> You also need to set up your own Amazon credentials in Ansible Vault. See above how
+to edit the Vault.
+
+**Provision the server**
+
+To provision your servers with Ansible, execute:
+
+```bash
+$ ansible-playbook ./ansible/playbook.yml -i ./ansible/hosts.ini -l aws --ask-vault-pass
+```
+
+Where `aws` is the host name which you want to provision. Also, you need to set up your
+server's public IP address in `ansible/hosts.ini`.
+
+**Deploy to production**
+
+To deploy the project to production with Ansistrano, execute:
+
+```bash
+$ ansible-playbook ./ansible/deploy.yml -i ./ansible/hosts.ini --ask-vault-pass
+```
